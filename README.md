STonitor2 is the successor to STonitor, an application intended to facilitate admining eGO servers by automatically
analyzing round logs into an easily digestible and actionable format, while providing additional log-related features,
such as automatic log saving.

Now compatible with CS2, STonitor2 is a complete rewrite of the original STonitor, with a focus on code quality,
modularity, and extensibility for future features and formats.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> *Do not rely solely on this program to determine whether something was an infraction, all analyses are done with only
the round logs as context. It can't possibly interpret anything that happened in game, it can only work with the
information provided to it.*
